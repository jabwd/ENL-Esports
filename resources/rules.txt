<p>These are the rules we use when playing a match.
Some rules might be very similar to CB, others might be different. So please take your time
to read these through. Every match has to be played with either the global or the ENL server configuration files for the correct format.<br />
If your server does not have these configs then you can get them here: <a href="http://www.enl-esports.com/resources/configs.zip">Configs</a></p>

<br />
<br />
<p>
For every match <b>TZ anti cheat is required</b>. Get it here: <a href="http://tz-ac.com">tz-ac.com</a> <br />
You also need to record an <b><i>in-eye</i></b> demo of every match. GTV nor demo's of a spectator is sufficient. However as soon as both teams agree then no demo is required. This will make it difficult to conflict the outcome of a match, so always record a demo.<!--<b>If the player is using Linux or Mac OS X then the player does not have to use SLAC</b>.
An easy way to determine whether someone is using Linux is by typing /cheaters in the console. <b>If a player is a Mac user he will need to make use
of BlackFire</b>, an xfire client for Mac. That way you can determine whether he is an actual Mac user. BlackFire does not slow down game play but it does
detect the game. you can find it on <a href="http://www.macxfire.com">this website</a>-->
It is disallowed to mess with the server configurations. It is illegal to create your own config for competition play.
<br />
The server configurations determine which cvars you can use on the client side.
<br />
Making use of cvar unlockers, aimkeys, wallhacks, ddos attacks or any other kind of <b>cheating is not allowed</b>
When you join a team you are not allowed to play an official match for the next 12 hours.
